# JPEGCorrupt
## A tool for producing neat visual effects by exploiting JPEG compression.


Similar to my other project [databend](http://github.com/cschlisner/databend), except this tool requires almost no processing time since it works by simply changing byte values inside a compressed image and lets the JPEG format do all of the work. However, the effects are unpredictable and unlike databend, you are not able to control the results nearly as easily. I'm working on it.
